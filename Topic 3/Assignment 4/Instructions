OBJECTIVES:
At the end of this assignment students will
•  Create the classes to implement a double linked list
•  Implement a driver for using the double linked list.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
For this project your will implement a double linked circular linked list to simulate a game of
musical chairs. You will build the doubly-linked class as well as the simulation.
Your driver will be tested against a series of input files. The input file will include a list of
students playing the game. Then a list of numbers for how long the song plays each round. Use
this number to go through the list to determine which player is eliminated from this round of
the game starting at the player currently at the front of the list. The player after the eliminated
player becomes the front of the list. Eliminated players are removed from the list.
Output the following:
A list of the players in the sorted order of input.
For each round until there is a winner
-  The ordinal number of the player eliminated and their name
-  A space separate list of the players still playing with the current front player first.
The name of who won.
PSEUDOCODE
Submit and get pseudocode approved for the driver software (what runs your game) before
coding it. You do NOT need to submit pseudocode for the linked list code.
SUBMIT
•  A driver that uses argv to get an input file name
•  A DLNode Class for a double linked list
o  data members: contents (int), pointer to previous node, pointer to next node
o  DLNode () : initialize contents to zero, next and previous to NULL
o  DLNode (int newContents) : initialize contents to newContents, next and previous to
NULL
o  virtual ~DLNode () : nothing to be done
o  void setContents (int newContents)
o  void setNext (DLNode* newNext)
o  void setPrevious (DLNode* newPrevious)
o  int getContents () const
o  DLNode* getNext () const
o  DLNode* getPrevious () const
•  A DLList class to contain all of the functionality of a doubly-linked list: push front, push
back, pop front, pop back, insert (sorted), remove, retrieve, overloaded operator <<,
constructor, destructor, clear, size
o  data members: count of nodes, pointer to head node, pointer to tail node
o  DLList () : initialize count to zero, head and tail to NULL
o  ~DLList () : call clear function
o  unsigned int getSize () const : return count
o  void pushFront (int newContents) : create new DLNode with newContents and attach at
head
o  void pushBack (int newContents) : create new DLNode with newContents and attach at
tail
o  void insert (int newContents) : create new DLNode with newContents and insert in
ascending (based on newContents) order
o  int getFront () const: return the value of the contents of the head node; throw an
exception (throw "LIST EMPTY") if the list is empty
o  int getBack () const : return the value of the contents of the tail node; throw an
exception (throw "LIST EMPTY") if the list is empty
o  bool get (int target) const : return true if target is in list, else return false
o  void popFront () : remove current head node; do nothing if list is empty
o  void popBack () : remove current tail node; do nothing if list is empty
o  bool removeFirst (int target) : remove the first instance of a DLNode containing target;
do nothing if target is not found
o  bool removeAll (int target) : remove all instances of DLNode containing target; do
nothing if target is not found
o  void clear () : clear all nodes from list, reset count to zero, set head and tail to NULL
o  friend ostream& operator<< (ostream& out, const DLList& src) : display the contents of
each node in the list, formatted per the program specification
("NUM1,NUM2,NUM3,...,NUMX"), to the output stream out
